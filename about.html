                <h1>Game Developer</h1>
                <p>To make your game functional and to fine-tune your mechanics, you will have to learn how to program. Currently, we are using the Unity game engine which requires the use of C#. Although it is nice to know the syntax and uses of the language, if you are not familiar with it you are still welcome to join and learn along the way. If you are programming we suggest you use the correct version of Unity and use Visual Studio.</p>

                <h1>Music Producer</h1>
                <p>You will learn to compose your own melodies, as well as learning the fundementals of chord progressions and song structure. As of right now, we're using bandlab, a versatile sound editor, as our main platform to make original soundtracks. No prior experience is required. All you need is some imagination and creativity.</p>

                <h1>Web Developer</h1>
                <p>In pursuit of creating a stylish and responive website, you will learn the basics of html and css. To make the collboration experience smoother for everyone, you will be required to familiarize youself with Github Desktop, a collaborative platform used for large-scale coding projects. As for those wondering about Java script, it is more for creating interative elements in which you can learn anytime. If you are considering becoming a web developer, we recommend that you have Visual Studio and Github Desktop installed.</p>
